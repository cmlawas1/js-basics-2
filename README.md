This program creates a users list containing their first name, last name, email, age, and unique ID
using a hardcoded array input. It contains two functions: generateUniqueID() and addAccount().

addAccount() checks if the input array is valid before appending a line to users.txt.
generateUniqueID() generates a unique ID based on a user's first name and last name, adding a unique alphanumeric string that is 8 characters long.
